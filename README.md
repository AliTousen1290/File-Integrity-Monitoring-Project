# File-Integrity-Monitoring-Project
It's a file integrity monitoring program.  

If you want to monitor your important files and save them from intruders, this is the right program you need.
Save your file in a specific folder and run the program in the PowerShell. That's all you need to do!

About the Program: 
The program is PowerShell scripted. You save your file in a specific folder or mention where the folder is in the script.
This program will hash all of the files in the folder and record it in a text. The program will continue to compare the files with the hashes it created the first time. If someone changes a single thing or deletes the file, it will generate a different hash and won't match with previous hash. then the program will give you notice that the file has been compromised so you can take action properly.
